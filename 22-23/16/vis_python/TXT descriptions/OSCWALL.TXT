Oscillating wall animation

This shows solution to 2-dimensional Navier-Stokes
equation for incompressible fluid, in low-amplitude approximation,
assuming these boundary conditions:  a lower boundary that moves
harmonically in time, and stationary fluid at plus infinity.
Each vertical tic mark is one viscous penetration depth.
The moving, wavy line is the location of a line of marked 
fluid elements, that would lie along the vertical axis if the
boundary were not moving.

See Landau and Lifshitz "Fluid Mechanics" Section 24.

Typing "L" toggles between this animation and one in which
the wall is stationary and the fluid moves in response to an
oscillating pressure gradient, as described in VISCOUS.TXT.
