For sharing library files among animations when
they run on Macs, it was necessary to create
mr7g.py and ThermoAc.exe, which allow all the
animations to be launched from mouse clicks in
a Mac.  

On a Mac, you can also access any animation through 
a command line or something like a hyperlink from 
within powerpoint, with syntax like this:

thermoac animation-option
for example:
thermoac viscous-m

Windows users don't need thermoAc.exe or mr7g.py, 
and they seem to make the animations run more slowly
on Windows sometimes.  But they work fine in Windows,
and we include them for Windows users in case 
future Windows operating systems are less friendly 
to our shortcuts in folder win7-vista-xp.
