Viscous penetration depth animation

First frame shows a central cross section of a long resonator, with an
oscillating piston at the right end.

If the oscillating piston moves at the correct frequency, it will excite
resonance.  Second frame adds plots of pressure and velocity of the 
half-wavelength mode in the resonator.

Third frame adds lines in the gas in the resonator, showing how 
elements of gas move in the standing wave.  Imagine tracer particles.

But these tracers show a nonzero velocity along the walls, which is 
impossible.  In this coarse view, we have assumed a negligibly small viscous
penetration depth.  Yellow circles in fourth frame shows region to be 
magnified in the next frame.

Fifth frame shows solution to 2-dimensional Navier-Stokes
equation for incompressible fluid, in low-amplitude approximation,
assuming these boundary conditions:  a lower boundary that is 
stationary, and uniform oscillating flow in the fluid at plus infinity.
Each vertical tic mark is one viscous penetration depth.
The moving, wavy line is the location of a line of marked 
fluid elements, that would lie along the vertical axis if the
fluid were not moving.

Typing "L" changes to zero oscillating pressure gradient and
oscillating wall. This shows solution to 2-dimensional Navier-Stokes
equation for incompressible fluid, in low-amplitude approximation,
assuming these boundary conditions:  a lower boundary that moves
harmonically in time, and stationary fluid at plus infinity.
Each vertical tic mark is one viscous penetration depth.
The moving, wavy line is the location of a line of marked 
fluid elements, that would lie along the vertical axis if the
boundary were not moving.
