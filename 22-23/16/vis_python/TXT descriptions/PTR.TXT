        Type "m" when prompted at the bottom of the
initial display.  This will ensure that the menu line
is always displayed, so you know what your options are.  When you're really 
familiar with this animation and are using it to explain this stuff to 
newcomers, you may want to suppress the menu line so it doesn't distract 
the newcomers from the meaningful parts of the display.  Typing any 
character other than "m" will suppress the menu display.

        Thereafter, typing a letter will access a particular display:

s   stirling refrigerator
o   piston-driven optr
O   optr driven by off-screen pressure source (e.g. thermoacoustic engine)
f   feedback ptr, ie a traveling-wave Stirling refrigerator

v   toggles the display of P dV ellipses on and off
d   toggles the display of 4-step words on and off (in Stirling only)

c   cold heat exchanger details, magnified
r   regenerator details, magnified
p   pulse tube details, magnified

F   faster
S   slower

q   quit

        In the discussion here, I'll do them in the order listed above....        
but you can select them in any order.  

        Stirling, optr, and Optr show the parts, the helium motion and 
pressure, and the mean temperature profile.

        v (short for volume toggle) turns on and off several p dV ellipses.  
It works during stirling, optr, and Optr modes.

        When switching among stirling, optr, and Optr, the change is 
immediate;  when one of the magnified views is invoked, a slow zoom action 
takes you from one view to another.  (To stay oriented, I am in the habit 
of going back to "optr" or "stirling" after each magnified view, but you can 
actually zoom directly from one magnified view to another.)

        You can also change the period of oscillation by hitting "F" for 
faster or "S" for slower.  Each time you hit one of those keys you change 
speed by a factor of 2.  The cold heat exchanger display seems to be 
clearer to most people if you go a little more slowly than 10 seconds.

        Quit at any time, and return to the operating system, by hitting "q".


***** stirling *****

        This is a traditional two-piston Stirling cryocooler.  The pistons 
move with different amplitudes and phases, such that the gas is compressed, 
displaced rightward, expanded, and displaced leftward.  The upper trace shows
the pressure as a function of time.  Viscosity in the regenerator causes a
small pressure gradient in the regenerator, in phase with the velocity.
The vertical moving blue lines in the refrigerator are tracer lines 
in the gas---imagine thin wisps of smoke.  They crowd closer together
when the pressure is high, signifying increased density.

        The red arrows show heat rejection and absorption at the heat 
exchangers.

        When "v" is toggled on, ellipses are drawn that trace the
pressure and piston-face position for each piston.  Since the volume in
front of a piston is the product of area and position (with suitable choice 
of the zero of position), the area of each ellipse represents the 
cycle-integral of P dV, i.e. the work.  Think about the signs carefully.  
Both pistons move to the right when pressure is high and move to the left
when pressure is low.  This means that the sense of work flow is from left
to right.  Hence, the left piston does work on the gas, while the right
piston absorbs work from the gas.   Note that the work absorbed by the
right piston is smaller than the work delivered by the left piston, as 
required by the second law of thermodynamics.  The work absorbed by the
right piston from the gas is usually fed back to the hot piston, thereby
reducing the work that the motor must deliver to the refrigerator.
Sometimes the work is fed back via the crankshaft and other mechanical
linkages;  that is what you should imagine when viewing this animation.
(However, in Stirling machines having a "displacer" piston, the cold gas
does work on the cold end of the displacer piston, and the hot end of
the displacer piston delivers that same work to the hot gas space between
the hot piston and the hot heat exchanger;  this reduces the work required
of the hot piston.)

***** optr *****

        This is a piston-driven orifice pulse tube refrigerator, with 
phasing appropriate for inertance plus resistance at the right end.

        From left to right, we have the drive piston, aftercooler, 
regenerator, cold heat exchanger, pulse tube, orifice/inertance, and 
reservoir volume. 

        When "v" is toggled on, we can imagine p dV ellipses for imaginary
pistons at various places in the apparatus.  At any location of a blue 
gas-position marker, we can imagine instead a thin piston with the same 
motion.  The work associated with that piston is the cycle integral of 
the pressure at that location d position.  This work is absorbed from the 
gas on the left of the imaginary piston by the left face of the 
imaginary piston and the same work is delivered to the gas on the right of
the imaginary piston by the right face of the imaginary piston.  Note
that the work flow at the left and right ends of the pulse tube are equal
(because there is no dissipation inbetween) although the details are 
different (tilt of ellipse changes due to compressibility of gas inbetween).
In the reservoir volume = adiabatic compliance, the gas moves adiabatically 
so the work flow is zero and the corresponding "ellipse" is a reciprocating
line enclosing no area.  

***** Optr *****

        This is the same as the optr display, except that the hot piston is
out of the picture.  Any source of oscillating pressure can be imagined
off screen left.

***** fptr *****

        The feedback ptr recovers the acoustic power that is dissipated
in the orifice of the optr.  In this recovery, it is similar to the Stirling
refrigerator, whose cold piston recovers pV power just to the right of
the cold heat exchanger, feeding that power into the crankshaft (or
whatever mechanism) and thence to the hot piston to reduce the power required
of the motor.

        The components in the upper half of the display are the same as
those of the optr (or Optr) displays.  In fact, the pressure and gas
displacement as functions of time and position are identical to those
of the stirling, optr, and Optr displays.

        The new components in the fptr display are a compliance (the 180
degree bend at the left), an inertance (the narrow neck at bottom-center),
and the union at the right.  We will see later how these new components
conspire to maintain the desired magnitudes and phases of pressure and
gas displacement in the upper half of the display.
        
        The acoustic oscillations are caused by a driver (a piston, a
standing-wave thermoacoustic engine, or a traveling-wave thermoacoustic
engine) somewhere off the
right edge of the screen.  At the coarsest level of approximation, this
driver causes the pressure to oscillate throughout the parts of the
refrigerator shown on the screeen.  The driver pushes gas into the picture,
raising the pressure;  the driver pulls gas out of the picture, lowering
the pressure.

        Next consider the pressure difference between the left and right
halves of the screen.  The pressure plots are identical at their left
and right extremes, as they must be because the corresponding hardware
components are "connected" via the compliance at the left and the union
at the right, neither of which can sustain a pressure difference.  The
left-to-right pressure difference occurs across the inertance in the
lower part of the display and across the regenerator and heat exchangers
in the upper part of the display.  Note how the pressure difference peaks
in time at the temporal extremes of the pressure oscillation.  The
regenerator is necessarily a resistive component, because it must have
tiny passages to ensure the good thermal contact necessary for efficient
Stirling cycle operation.  Hence the pressure difference across the
regenerator is in phase with the velocity through it;  the pressure
difference is largest when the gas motion is fastest.  In contrast, we
want the inertance to experience as little dissipation as possible, and
hence to have as little resistance as possible.  If it is a pure inertance,
the pressure difference across it is largest when the gas acceleration is
largest, i.e. when the gas velocity is zero.  So the gas motion
in the lower part of the figure leads the gas motion in the upper half
by about 90 degrees.

When "v" is enabled, the areas of the pV loops show the acoustic power
flowing past each point.  Note that the loops in the lower half circulate
counterclockwise, signifying power flow from right to left, while those
in the upper half circulate clockwise, signifying power flow from left to
right.  The left-upper, left-lower, and center-lower ellipses have equal
areas, signifying equal powers, because there is no dissipation between
them in this idealized animation.  Their area is the sum of the areas
of the two ellipses representing the powers flowing into the union (the
driver power and the power at the hot end of the pulse tube).  The driver
power is therefore less than it would be in the absense of power feedback.


***** regenerator *****

        In the regenerator, gaps between solid parts are small, much smaller
than a thermal penetration depth.  Hence the gas blob is always in excellent
thermal contact with the adjacent solid parts, so the temperatures of gas 
and adjacent solid always match.  To accomplish this, heat must flow 
between gas and solid as shown by the red arrows.  This process 
consumes work, so the loop in the pressure-volume diagram circulates 
counterclockwise.  Note that this pressure-volume diagram refers to a 
particular mass element of gas;  this is a different concept than the 
pressure-volume diagrams toggled on and off with the "v" command, which
are associated with pistons or imaginary pistons.


***** cold heat exchanger *****

        As in the regenerator, the gaps are small
so thermal contact is good.  The gas leaves the cold heat exchanger and
goes out into open spaces to the right.  The pressure then goes down, so
the blob's volume increases and its temperature decreases.  Hence it is
pretty cold when it re-enters the cold heat exchanger, so it can extract
a lot of heat (big red arrows) from the cold heat exchanger.  It then 
cruises in and out of the regenerator, exchanging heat there 
cyclically just like the gas in the "regenerator" display does.

        
***** pulse tube *****

        This region acts like an adiabatic thermal buffer.  The gas
is not in good thermal contact with any solid.  Hence the temperature
of a given blob of gas just goes up and down with the pressure, 
adiabatically.  Nearby blobs are at slightly different temperatures, and 
they also experience adiabatic temperature oscillations.  The overall
picture is of a smooth temperature gradient that moves with the gas and
rises and falls a little with the pressure oscillations.  No work is 
absorbed by this isolated, adiabatic blob, so its pV diagram is simply
a reciprocating adiabat with zero area.  Note the distinction between this
pV diagram for a given mass element of gas vs the pV power transmitted 
along the pulse tube which is visible in the overall "o"ptr view when 
"v"olume is toggled on.
