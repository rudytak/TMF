Traveling - standing wave animation

This shows a wave in a duct;  initially it is a rightward
traveling wave.

Upper graphs show pressure and velocity in the duct.

Marker lines in the gas in the duct show how the gas moves.

You can change the wave, by changing the ratio 
of amplitudes of rightward and leftward traveling waves that
are superimposed to generate the animation.  Type "c" to
initiate change sequence...

Type "0" and hit Enter to make a leftward traveling wave.  

Type "1" and hit Enter for rightward traveling wave.

Type "0.5" and hit Enter for a standing wave, for which the right and
leftward components have equal amplitude.  Note velocity and displacement
nodes, which really only exist for a pure standing wave.

Enter intermediate values to view other waves.

While wave is running, type "v" to turn on/off p dV diagrams at a couple
of typical locations in the wave.  When these circulate clockwise, acoustic
power flows from left to right;  when they circulate counterclockwise,
acoustic power flows from right to left.
