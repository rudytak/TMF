The folder "DeltaEC Examples" and all of its
contents can be copied or moved anywhere you want,
modified in any way, or completely deleted.  
Nothing here affects how DeltaEC runs.

Some users choose to put an archival copy of 
this folder in a protected location, such as the
DeltaEC installation directory, and then make
a working copy elsewhere.
